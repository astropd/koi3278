This contains a stand-alone version of the code used to analyze the
self-lensing binary system KOI-3278, as it appears in Science (add
ref). It will reproduce the bulk of our analysis, including the MCMC
modeling and the key figures, notably Figure 2 of the main text.

If you make use of this code please cite our work:
Kruse & Agol, Science 2014 (add real ref when available)

We have also included the KOI-3278 light curve (in lightcurve/) as
well as the Padova isochrones (padova/) and the white dwarf models
(wdmodels/) used.

Everything can be run using python assuming the following packages are
installed:
sys
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
glob
astropy
emcee

To reproduce all that we have done, one can simply run the shell
script './run.sh' and all the figures should appear. This procedure
should take less than a minute to complete.

If you would like to generate the table of median model values and
their one-sided error bars, you can change the texout variable in
mcmc_analyze.py from None to any file name. This will take a couple
minutes to complete.

Finally, if you would like to perform your own MCMC run, you can
change the domcmc variable in mcmc_run.py from False to True. The
length of the run will depend on the number of walkers and iterations
(also chosen as variables in the file), but with the defaults it will
take ~24 hours.
